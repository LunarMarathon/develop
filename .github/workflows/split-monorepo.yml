# Split the monorepo into readonly branches
# TODO: Some way to preserve commit messages? I'd love to get some help here. 
#       âœ” Done, though it only gets the latest commit. It would be great to have something that handles all commit messages. Or at least says "<commit msg> (and X more [commits]) Maybe this could be done by creating an auto-closing PR listing all the commits since the last merge? Preferably filtered to only contain changes affecting the package.
