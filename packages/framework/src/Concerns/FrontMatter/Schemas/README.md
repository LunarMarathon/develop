# Working draft for front matter schema documentation

The schema traits define the public API used for front matter.
Each supported front matter setting will have a corresponding class property in the appropriate schema trait.
For example, blog post data will be in the BlogPostSchema trait.

The names of the properties should match the names of the front matter settings.
For example, the `title` property will be the `title` front matter setting.
