        <h1>HydeRC Dashboard Manual</h1>

        <h2>Important Note</h2>
        <p>
            As this is alpha stage software there may be bugs,
            and usage is at your own risk. You should always keep
            backups using Git version control or similar.
        
            A version allowing for community editing by creating
            a public static HTML dashboard is planned, this would
            then link to files on GitHub for collaboration.
			Though, this idea may instead be handled in a separate
			package included as a dashboard.blade.php file,
			using the default layout.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            As the dashboard modifies files on the computer running it
            and gives arbitrary access to the server by running shell
            commands, opening files, and executing programs, it is
            extremely important that the dashboard is not exposed
            to the internet. You must only ever use this dashboard
            as a local development tool.

            A basic check is made to block requests not made from
            localhost as an extra precaution. You should still
            never make the dashboard.php file publicly accessible.
