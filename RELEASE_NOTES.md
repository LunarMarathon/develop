## [Unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD

### About

This update makes changes to the internal Markdown services. If you have written code or integrations that uses any of these services, you may want to take a closer look. Otherwise, this should not affect you much.

Many Markdown related classes have been moved to a new namespace, and the classes themselves have been restructured. Again, this only affects those who in the past have used these classes outside of what Hyde normally provides.

Due to the nature of this refactor, where so much have been changed, not everything is documented here. See the attached pull request for the full Markdown change diff: https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/318
