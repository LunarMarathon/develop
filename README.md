# Hyde Realtime Server

## Important! âš  This feature is experimental at best and is in no way intended to be used in production.
Though, why you would want a dynamic web server to serve static HTML I don't know anyway.

So again, this is just a local testing tool and comes with no warranty in any way whatsoever.

## Usage

> Note, all paths are relative to the package root and will be updated when the package is released.

To start a preconfigured server with the default settings, run:

Unix:

```bash
$ bash ./bin/serve.sh
```

Windows:
```powershell
PS: .\bin\serve.bat
```

Or if you want to start the server with a custom port:

```bash
php -S localhost:80 server.php
```
