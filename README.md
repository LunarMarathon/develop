## Make static websites, blogs, and documentation pages with the tools you already know and love.

HydePHP is a content-first Laravel-powered Static Site Builder that allows you to create static HTML pages, blog posts, and documentation sites using Markdown.
Hyde is all about letting you get started quickly while giving you the power and freedom of doing things the way you want to.

Markdown purist? That's all you need. Blade artisan? Go for it.
Hyde comes with hand-crafted frontend templates so you can focus on your content.
You don't _need_ to customize anything. But you _can_ customize everything.

See the documentation and learn more at https://hydephp.github.io/docs/

## Features

### Content Creation
- Create blog posts using Markdown and Front Matter.
- Create documentation pages from plain Markdown, no front matter needed!
- Create simple pages using Markdown, or create advanced ones using Laravel Blade.
- You can scaffold blog posts and Markdown pages to automatically fill in the front matter.
- You can also scaffold Blade pages to automatically use the default layout.

### Built-in Frontend
- Hyde comes with a TailwindCSS starter kit so you can start making content right away.
- The starter kit is fully responsive, has a dark mode theme, and is customizable.
- The frontend is accessible to screenreaders and rich with semantic HTML and microdata. 
- Hyde automatically chooses the right layout to use depending on the content being rendered.
- Hyde also fills in and creates content like navigation menus and sidebars automatically.

### Customization
- You don't need to configure anything as Hyde is shipped with sensible defaults.
- You can, however, customize nearly everything. Here are some examples:
- All frontend components and page layouts are created with Blade so you 
  can publish the vendor views, just like in Laravel.
- Override many of the dynamic content features like the menus and footer.


## Live Demo & Media
### The Hyde Website
The Hyde site (https://hydephp.github.io/) is fully built with Hyde. That includes the homepage, the blog, and the documentation.
You can also take a look at the [Gallery page](https://hydephp.github.io/gallery). It is created using the Blade page module in Hyde and contains interactive graphics showcasing Hyde.

## Getting Started - High-level overview
> See [Installation Guide](https://hydephp.github.io/docs/master/installation.html) and [Getting Started](https://hydephp.github.io/docs/master/getting-started.html) for the full details.

It's a breeze to get started with Hyde. Create a new Hyde project using Composer:

```bash
composer create-project hyde/hyde
```

Next, place Markdown or Blade files in the content directories, or use the `hyde:make` command to scaffold them.
The content files are stored in the following directories: `_posts`, `_docs`, and `_pages`. The first two only support Markdown, however, `_pages` accept both Markdown and Blade.
The directory you place your file in will determine what Blade template to render the content into, as well as the filepath for the compiled file.

> For example, a file stored as `_posts/hello-world.md` will be compiled into the `post.blade.php` layout and saved as `_site/posts/hello-world.html`.

Next, run the build command to compile your static site:
```bash
php hyde build
```
Your website HTML files are saved in the `_site` directory and are ready to be served!
