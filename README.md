## Make static websites, blogs, and documentation pages with the tools you already know and love.

HydePHP is a content-first Laravel-powered Static Site Builder that allows you to create static HTML pages, blog posts, and documentation sites using Markdown, optionally with YAML Front Matter.

Need more control? You can also use Laravel Blade to get the full power of dynamic templating and absolute control over HTML.

Hyde is modular, configurable, and hackable - allowing you to customize everything - but only if you want to. Hyde follows convention over configuration, allowing you to get an awesome blog or a smooth documentation site up and running in mere minutes. All the TailwindCSS and Blade templates you need for your site are already configured.

Write a lot of code examples? Hyde automatically enables [Torchlight.dev](https://torchlight.dev/) highlighting for you when you add an API token in the `.env` file.

See the documentation and learn more at https://hydephp.github.io/docs/

## Features

### Create content faster than ever

Hyde comes preinstalled with a responsive TailwindCSS starter kit for static pages, blogs, and documentation sites alike. It has dark mode support, is mobile-friendly, and is accessible to screen readers.

Just write your content in Markdown, and Hyde will automatically generate the site from it. Depending on what folder you stored the Markdown file in, Hyde will choose the appropriate layout from one of the many built-in templates.

For example, storing a file in the `_posts` directory will render the Markdown HTML in a Blog Post template with strong support for Front Matter. Files in the `_docs` directory use the Documentation Page layout with an automatic sidebar. Markdown files in the `_pages` directory are rendered into a simple blank page putting the focus on your content. When using Blade pages you can choose which layout to use, or create your own!

### No messing with routes, links, etc.

Hyde automatically creates and populates navigation menus and documentation sidebars.

All internal links use relative links that automatically get the appropriate level of `../`'s depending on the file path.

For example, if you create a Markdown file as `_pages/about-us.md`, an 'About Us' link will be added to the navigation menu automatically.

### You're not limited to just Markdown
There may be times when you need more control than Markdown can offer. In this case, you can create pages using Laravel Blade. You can extend the default layout to take advantage of the built-in styles and components as well as the dynamic PHP templating, or if you prefer, stick with vanilla HTML. Hyde will compile it to a static page. And of course, you can mix and match between Markdown and Blade as you wish.

## Live Demo & Media
### The Hyde Website
The Hyde site (https://hydephp.github.io/) is fully built with Hyde. That includes the homepage, the blog, and the documentation.

## Getting Started - High-level overview
> See [Installation Guide](https://hydephp.github.io/docs/master/installation.html) and [Getting Started](https://hydephp.github.io/docs/master/getting-started.html) for the full details.

It's a breeze to get started with Hyde. Create a new Hyde project using Composer:

```bash
composer create-project hyde/hyde
```

Next, place Markdown or Blade files in the content directories: `_posts`, `_docs`, and `_pages`. You can even use full Blade views in the `_pages` directory.

You can scaffold files using the `hyde make` command.
```bash
php hyde make:page|post
```

Next, run the build command to compile your static site:
```bash
php hyde build
```
Your website HTML files are saved in the `_site` directory and are ready to be served!
