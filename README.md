## About

HydePHP is a content-first Laravel-powered Static Site Builder that allows you to create static HTML pages, blog posts, and documentation sites using Markdown.
Hyde is all about letting you get started quickly, while giving you the power and freedom of doing things the way you want to.

Markdown purist? That's all you need. Blade artisan? Go for it.
Hyde comes with hand-crafted frontend templates so you can focus on your content.
You don't _need_ to customize anything. But you _can_ customize everything.

> Note: This repository contains the core code of the Hyde framework. If you want to build an application using Hyde, visit the [main Hyde repository](https://github.com/hydephp/hyde) which also serves as a template to get started quickly.
