## v2.0 Release Notes

### Preface

This release completely rewrites the Hyde Realtime Compiler.

The application server is now powered by the lightweight [Microserve](https://github.com/caendesilva/microserve)
HTTP server API, providing a robust and fast way to route and handle requests without any extra dependencies.

In addition, the source files are no longer compiled by calling the HydeCLI in a separate process,
instead, the server compiles source files directly through the Hyde Framework code without any
intermediary process.

This gives the huge benefit of being able to catch errors and exceptions directly,
without having to search for them in the console output like in v1.x.

### Internal Changes

- HTTP logic is handled by [Microserve](https://github.com/caendesilva/microserve), through the HttpKernel.
- Requests are sent to the Router to be processed by the appropriate handler.
- Web pages are compiled through the [Hyde Framework](https://github.com/hydephp/framework), instead of calling the HydeCLI.
- Static assets are proxied directly without booting the entire framework.
- Exceptions are handled by [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops), through the ExceptionHandler.
- The server.php is moved to the `bin` directory.

### API Changes

The way the server works for the end-user has not been changed much.
Most people will not even notice anything but the new features.

The only real change is that applications will need to point to the
new `server.php` file which is now located in the `bin` directory.

The debug/console output has been removed.
